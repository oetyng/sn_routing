### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* **deps:** Query response content changed.
* **deps:** update sn_messaging to v20.0.0
* **deps:** update sn_messaging to 0.19.0
* **deps:** sn_messaging major version bump
* **deps:** New major version for sn_messaging.
* for aggregate_at_src message, notify sn_node with proof as well
* **deps:** Node message members changed.
* new version of routing
- This commit is mainly to cover the change of Peer. Which used by
a public struct but won't trigger the version update automatically.
* **deps:** new version of sn_messaging
- Also removes handling of the unused `AtSource` aggregation scheme.
* **dep:** the new qp2p version includes a breaking change
* Events removed and event members changed.
* The `proof_chain` field of `Event::MessageReceived` is now `Option`.
* Added `additional_proof_chain_key` parameter to  `Routing::send_message`, added `proof_chain` field to `Event::MessageReceived`.
* `Routing::neighbour_sections` renamed to `other_sections`.
* DT update. Naming and message structs for splits
* `Routing::match_section` renamed to `Routing::matching_section`
* remove `Event::PromotedToAdult` and the `startup_relocation` field of `Event::MemberJoined`, both parts of public API.
* **tokio:** new Tokio v1 is not backward compatible with previous runtime versions < 1.
* **data-types:** new Sequence data-type doesn't allow Policy mutations.
* **messaging:** send_message api now requires an itinerary argument
* **accumulation:** this uses a new version of sn_messaging with a breaking
change
* added new field to the `Event::EldersChanged` variant.
* **deps:** removes send_message_to_client api,
* this changes the return type of State::new
* remove unused Error::NodeMessaging variant
*     - remove `Error::BadLocation` (use the more specific `InvalidSrcLocation` / `InvalidDstLocation` instead)
    - rename `Error::InvalidSource` to `Error::InvalidSrcLocation`
    - rename `Error::InvalidDestination` to `Error::InvalidDstLocation`
* this affects the `Error` type which is a part of the public API.
*     - remove `Routing::secret_key_share` (use `Routing::sign_with_secret_key_share` instead).
    - Rename `Error::InvalidElderDkgResult` to `Error::MissingSecretKeyShare`
    - `Routing::public_key_set` and `Routing::our_index` now return `MissingSecretKeyShare` instead of `InvalidState` on error.
* use `use sn_routing::Event;` instead of `use sn_routing::event::Event;`.
* `Event` changes:

- Remove `Event::Connected` - not needed because `Routing::new` now returns fully connected routing instance.
- Add `Event::Relocated` - replaces `Event::Connected(Connected::Relocate)`
- Remove `Event::InfantJoined` - merged with `MemberJoined`
- Change `Event::MemberJoined::previous_name` to `Option` to allow distinguishing between new and relocated peers.
* remove size fields within routing::Config
* remove NetworkParams
* some methods of `Routing` that previosuly returned `Option<T>` or `Result<T>` now return just T.
* rename Instance to Routing
* `Node` and `NodeConfig` are part of the public API.

### [0.32.1]
* Bugfix to avoid handling recently-disconnected client direct messages.

### [0.32.0]
* Allow mock-crust network to support multiple nodes/clients with the same IPs.
* Allow only one client ip per proxy.
* Modify the client Rate Limiter paradigm to not put an upper threshold on number of clients with unique IPs to bootstrap off a proxy.
* Add dev configuration options for routing such that these options can be supplied in a routing config file that routing would read to tweak parameters such as disable resource proof etc.

* Move `AccountPacket` type required by vaults and clients into a `common_types` module.

### [0.29.0]

* Peer manager clean up as connect success now tells us everything about the peer. Previously we needed to wait additionally for NodeIdentify for instance as crust-uid (PeerId) and routing-uid (PublicId) were separate and each layer informed about the id specific to that layer only.

### [0.28.1]
* Retry preparing connection info if Crust returns an error.

### [0.28.0]
* Profile the bandwidth of nodes joining the network. Reject slow nodes.
* Organise nodes into disjoint sections. Introduce the `Section` and
  `PrefixSection` authorities.
* Maintain lists of signatures of neighbouring sections, which will enable
  secure  message validation.
* Accumulate messages in the sending group/section, then send the messages with
  all the signatures across a single route. This reduces the number of total
  invididual hop messages that need to be sent.
* Routes are now disjoint: Retrying to send a message along a different route
  cannot potentially fail on the same node again.
* Merge the routing_table crate into routing.
* Remove the internal event handling thread. Events should be handled in the
  upper library's event loop. That way, some message passing can be replaced by
  direct calls to routing methods.

### [0.24.0]

  rustc-serializable types anymore and breaks builds.
* Avoid redundant hash calculations by making the data `name` method a simple
  getter.
* Fix ack handling when resending a message.
* Some refactoring and test updates.

### [0.23.2]
* Don't cache as a member of recipient group: this can cause redundant
  responses.

* Send acknowledgement messages (acks) and resend via a different route only if
  no ack is received. Previously, several routes were used simultaneously,
  wasting a lot of bandwidth.
* Merge xor_name into routing.
* Simplify the message type hierarchy and the API.
* Fix sending redundant connection info.

### [0.19.1]
* network size < GROUP_SIZE will only accept new nodes via first node

### [0.16.0]
* Add `identifier()` method to all data elements (type + name)
* All `ImmutableData` types now concrete (not variants)

### [0.15.1]
